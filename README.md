Midterm Peripheral Selection

This GitHub page is for my Midterm chip/peripheral selection.
The wiki page will be a guide for everything that is on this repository.

Wiki: https://github.com/Chuja1/LED-Matrix/wiki

Note that due to many issues with trying to write and compile C code, the code on this page will be Arduino IDE code. I do not expect any points for this but I did not want to have no deliverables for this midterm.

Peripheral: SainSmart LEDuino 8x32 LED Matrix

LED Type: WorldSemi WS2812B IC LED
